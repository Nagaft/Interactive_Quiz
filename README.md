# Interactive_Quiz
This project is a JavaScript quiz that tests your knowledge of JavaScript fundamentals. It presents a series of multiple-choice questions. The project also includes a timer to add a time constraint to the quiz and a high score feature to store and display the scores of previous participants.

Getting Started
To get started with the JavaScript quiz, follow these steps:

Open the index.html file in a web browser.
Quiz Structure
The quiz consists of a set of predefined questions stored in an array called questions. Each question object in the array contains the following properties:

question: The actual question as a string.
choices: An array of strings representing the possible choices for the question.
answer: The correct answer as a string.
The quiz is implemented using JavaScript and manipulates the DOM (Document Object Model) to dynamically display the questions, choices, and feedback to the user.

The following are the main components of the project:

HTML Structure
The index.html file contains the HTML structure for the quiz. It includes elements for displaying the question, choices, timer, result, and high scores.

CSS Styling
The style.css file contains the CSS styles for the quiz, providing visual formatting and layout to the HTML elements.

JavaScript Logic
The script.js file contains the JavaScript code that handles the quiz functionality. It includes functions for starting the quiz, displaying questions and choices, checking answers, managing the timer, saving scores, and restarting the quiz.

Here is a brief explanation of the main functions:

startQuiz(): Initializes the quiz by hiding the start button and showing the quiz container. It also resets the score, current question index, and quiz finish state.

showQuestion(): Displays the current question and its choices dynamically by manipulating the DOM.

checkAnswer(answer): Checks the selected answer against the correct answer. Updates the score and displays feedback to the user.

endQuiz(): Ends the quiz by stopping the timer, hiding the quiz container, and displaying the final result. It also shows the score submission form and try again button.

startTimer(): Starts the countdown timer and updates the timer element every second. When the time is up or the quiz is finished, it stops the quiz.

saveScore(event): Handles the score submission by capturing the user's initials and storing the score in local storage. It also updates the high score list.

tryAgain(): Resets the quiz by hiding the score section, submit button, and try again button, and then restarting the quiz.

Local Storage
The project uses local storage to store and retrieve high scores. When a user submits their score, it is stored in local storage as an array of objects, each representing a score with initials and score value.

Customization and Extension
You can customize and extend the JavaScript quiz project in several ways, including:

Modifying the existing questions or adding new questions to the questions array.
Changing the quiz timer duration.
Updating the quiz styling and layout in the CSS file.
Adding more features, such as a countdown timer animation or a difficulty level selection.
Feel free to explore the code and make modifications according to your requirements and preferences.

Conclusion
The JavaScript quiz project provides an interactive way to test your knowledge of JavaScript concepts. It demonstrates the use of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to create a dynamic quiz application.
